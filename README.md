# C3G_tests
This repository contains the results and code of the tests required by the [Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/gsoc_2020/src/master/). I am mainly interested to work on the project titled "Creating a new pipeline for long-read RNA-seq using StringTie v2"
