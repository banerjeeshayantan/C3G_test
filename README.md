# C3G_tests
This repository contains the results and code of the tests required by a student to complete in order to apply for the organisation [Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/gsoc_2020/src/master/) for GSOC 2020. I am mainly interested to work on the project titled "Creating a new pipeline for long-read RNA-seq using StringTie v2"
